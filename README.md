# Hate speech detector

This repository contains the implementation of a keras/tensorflow LSTM + Word2Vec classifier model aimed at detecting hate speech in a collection of tweets.

There are two ipython notebooks in the `notebooks` folder, one is a tutorial explaining the basic concepts of NLP data processing, feature engineering and model training, and the second one is the representation of the code in the current repo.

To setup, activate your virtualenv, run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your shell.
